TODO (in order of importance):
- fix NSEC(3) querycache issue
- Create 'how to' section in docs.
- Packet forwarding - not sure what to do. If not support, then document.
- use msgPrefix everywhere.
- check (and resolve) how we handle backends that do not support dyndns (send notimpl)
- WKS record is not supported (document this)
