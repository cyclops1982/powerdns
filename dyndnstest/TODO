- Habbie's comments:
	- QType isSupportedType() loop.
	- Change all test to use nsupdate (and add -t 1 to nsupdate command)

- The prio in my DB was NULL, which made the update query not work.
  Either we need to change the query (with some if statement if 0 || NULL) or we make check-zone complain about it?

- testing:
	- WKS record is not supported (for replace)
	- test if axfr still works (with TSIG)

Cleanup:
	- Change sql query name, so we can identify them for dyndns
	- Use msgPrefix everywhere.
	- Make sure backends that do not support dyndns return NotImpl.

- Documentation
	- new chapter on dyndns
	- Update backend-writers code

"Out of scope"
- Forward update packet?
