- Habbie's comments:
	- Rectify zone
	- section 3.2.3 returns NXRRSet.
	- Rework line 866 and lower (section 3.4.2)
		- Ask for SOA?
		- Only do lookup once
		- Usage of rfc1982 method
	- Update section before the delete section?
	- Where we use list() - rewrite because it is wrong - this should also take care of double rLabel == di->zone on line 937/940
	- QType isSupportedType() loop.
	- Change test to nsupdate or create update-script with parameters?

- Record testing:
	- SRV record is not supported (because getZoneRepresentation() is not implemented)
	- BUG:  MX record does not work, because getZoneRepresentation() does not work.
	- WKS record is not supported (for replace)

- Backends
	- Make sure backends that do not support dyndns return NotImpl.
	- BindBackend is something that we would need at release, at the moment it is not up to date.

- Permissions
	- Add support for TSIG (global parameter?)
	- Add per domain support for IP-range and TSIG.

- Forward update packet?
- Use msgPrefix everywhere.
