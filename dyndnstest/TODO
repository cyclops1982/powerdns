- Habbie's comments:
	- Add test to see if domain is secure, before doing all the dnssec stuff ?
	- Clean up rectify code. 
	- QType isSupportedType() loop.
	- Change all test to use nsupdate.

- Record testing:
	- WKS record is not supported (for replace)
	- test if axfr works

- Backends
	- Make sure backends that do not support dyndns return NotImpl.
	- BindBackend is something that we would need at release, at the moment it is not up to date.

- Permissions
	- Add support for TSIG (global parameter?)
	- Add per domain support for IP-range and TSIG.

- Forward update packet?
- Use msgPrefix everywhere.
