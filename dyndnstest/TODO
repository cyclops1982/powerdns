- Change all test to use nsupdate (and add -t 1 to nsupdate command)
- Check if allow-2136-from works with IPv6 and how it handles ipv6 with 0.0.0.0/0

- testing:
	- WKS record is not supported (for replace)

Cleanup:
	- Use msgPrefix everywhere.
	- Make sure backends that do not support dyndns return NotImpl.

- Documentation
	- update/add the TODO's.
	- Fix disable-rfc2136 and the c2136 issue.
