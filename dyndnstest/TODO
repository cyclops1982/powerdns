- Change all test to use nsupdate (and add -t 1 to nsupdate command)

- SOA-edit option for dyndns
  A specific soa-edit (SOA-EDIT-2136 ?) could help is tune the SOA-changes that are required after an update.

- testing:
	- WKS record is not supported (for replace)

Cleanup:
	- Change sql query name, so we can identify them for dyndns
	- Use msgPrefix everywhere.
	- Make sure backends that do not support dyndns return NotImpl.

- Documentation
	- new chapter on dyndns
	- Update backend-writers code

"Out of scope"
- Forward update packet?
