TODO (in order of importance):
- Bind-dnssec test still fails the 1dyndns-update-in-between
- Look at 1dyndns-update-in-between nsec3 test and see if it's expected_result.nsec3 is correct
- Look at 1dyndns-update-in-between narrow test. Why is the TTL different?
- use msgPrefix everywhere.
- Packet forwarding - not sure what to do. If not support, then document.
- Re-read the howto section - and decide if it should be in the doc or not.
- WKS record is not supported (document this)


Run the full test suite! ;-)
