- Habbie's comments:
	- Section 3.2.3 - Returning NXRRSet.
	- Ask for SOA when we need to
	- use rfc1982lessthan
	- Rework update section to only do the lookup once.
	- PRIO in delete query

- Bugs
	- Delete on MX record does not work. For some reason the moadnsparser does not parse that packet correctly. d_clen is 0 ?

- Backends
	- Backends that do not support slave operation, cannot perform the tests. There needs to be a way to hand this properly (aka, pdns should not crash but report NotImpl)
	- BindBackend is something that we would need at release, at the moment it is not up to date.

- Record testing:
	- WKS record is not supported (for replace)
	- SRV record is not supported (because getZoneRepresentation() is not implemented)

- We might need to perform a RectifyZone after an update. This logic is in pdnssec tool and after the AXFR
	- Centralize the logic
	- Add it at the end of the packet processing and before the commit to db.

- Permissions
	- Add support for TSIG (global parameter?)
	- Add per domain support for IP-range and TSIG.

- Follow up on TODO's in source
