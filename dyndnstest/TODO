- Habbie's comments:
	- QType isSupportedType() loop.
	- Change all test to use nsupdate.

- Record testing:
	- WKS record is not supported (for replace)
	- test if axfr still works (with TSIG)

- Backends
	- Make sure backends that do not support dyndns return NotImpl.
	- BindBackend is something that we would need at release, at the moment it is not up to date.

- Forward update packet?
- Use msgPrefix everywhere.
